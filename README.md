# darktable_extra_scripts
Additional lua scripts for darktable that won't be included in the official repository or only tailored for my own personal needs

## Helicon Focus

This script adds a new panel to the lighttable that lets you export a couple of selected images an pass them to the (commercial) focus stacking application Helicon Focus.

The resulting image(s) are then imported into darktable again.

Optionally you can add new keywords to the imported image(s) and copy all keywords from the source images to the results.
